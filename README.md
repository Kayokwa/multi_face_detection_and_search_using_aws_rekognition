# multi_face_detection_and_search_using_aws_rekognition
This script demonstrates how one could search for multiple faces in an image against an AWS Rekognition collection. 
It also includes how one could go about cropping detected faces from an image and stroring these faces on a local drive for use in the investigation later.
Feel free to modify the solution according to your use case.
